Application - 
	1. Rich client(Rich internet Application - RIA) - high client expectations
	Heavily works on internet, 
	2. Thin client  - no expectation from client side. Only network and browser is enough. E.g teams can work on browser also.
  
Monolith-bulky applications, built as a single unit)

micro services-
Break application into small services like in case if uber booking keep search app, payment app, etc different to avoid server over loading with users
	
Load-
1. Predictable load
2. Unpredictable load

--------------------------------------------AWS-------------------------------------
Load Balancer -
Client connects to load balancer then it connects to one of the server which is up.
Load balancer has its own IP address
It uses round robin to transfer the load to servers available.
Advantage - if one of the server crash the load can be transferred to other servers easily.

Elasticity - scaling up and down according to the need.

Cloud provider
	1. AWS
	2. Azure
	3. GCP

5 essential characteristics of cloud computing
	1. On demand self service
	2. Broad network access
	3. Resource pooling
	4. Rapid elasticity
	5. Measured service
	6.Multi tenacity

Types of cloud computing:
	1. Infrastructure as a service - just providing the infrastructure and rest setting up on us. 
		a. AWS
		b. Azure
		c. GCE(Google compute engine)
	2. Platform as a service - IAAS + some tool/appln
		a. Apprenda
		b. All IAAS applications
	3. Software as a service - use and configure the provided software only.
		a. Google app
		b. Teams

Deployment models
	1. Private - open for only specific network
	2. Hybrid - both
	3. Community - 
	4. Public - open cloud
