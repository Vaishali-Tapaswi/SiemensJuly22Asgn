Applications - 
  Rich Client - high expectations from client
  Thin Client - low expectations
                it works by connecting to remote server, where application and data are stored
  Rich Internet Application - Web-based applications
                              It requires a browser to deliver user application
                           
Monolith (Heavy or bulky applications)
  Client -> Presentation layer -> Business layer -> Persistent layer -> Database
  They are complex and contains multiple functions coupled tightly into one large application. If one program component must be updated, 
  other elements may also require rewriting, and the whole application has to be recompiled and tested
  
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) - designed to give services to other applications through the protocol. They are self contained.
                                      eg: any payment gateway 

Cloud Computing
  Load balancer - dividing workload and computing properties. It has it's own IP and decides which server to use by round robin method
  Failover - it is the ability to seamlessly and automatically switch to a reliable backup system
  Scalibility - used to handle the growing workload where good performance is also needed to work efficiently with software or applications.
  Elasticity - used to handle the growing workload where good performance is also needed to work efficiently with software or applications
  
Characters - 
  - On demand self service
  - Broad network service 
  - Resource pooling
  - Rapid elasticity
  - Measured service
  - Multi-tenacity (Shared resources)
 
Services
 - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - infrastructure is provided as outsourcing to enterprises such as networking equipment, devices, database, and web servers. 
 - Platform as a service (PaaS) - hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure.
 - Software as a Service(SaaS) - cannot modify software given, can only use and modify
 
AWS
 - Created AWS account
 - S3 bucket provides object storage, which is built for storing and recovering any amount of information or data.
 - Created bucket and made public to access it from the URL
 - S3 glacier is a secure and durable service for low-cost data archiving and long-term backup.
 - Created groups and added users with policies and access permissions
