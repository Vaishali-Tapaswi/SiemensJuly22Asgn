When to choose Iaas + DatabaseInstallation vs RDS
RDS makes the database management easy and simple as compared to oracle. It is used when we want to scale the instance type up or down based on your workload patterns without being concerned about licensing and the complexity involved. 
Whereas oracle with ec2 gives more flexibilty and choice. These two can be used as per need.
